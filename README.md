# Plarx

A bundle with a set of classes fixing and extending various aspects of the [Laravel PHP framework](http://laravel.com) (v3).

Among the most notable things are **DoubleEdge**, **Eloquent** and **HLEx** classes.

**DoubleEdge** is a cookie-cutting controller with implied support for AJAX and web requests; have your action methods return arrays, Eloquent models, Queries, Views, Redirects and let DoubleEdge convert these to representation appropriate for current client - such as JSON for AJAX, string rendered from a View - and not just any view, it might include site template wrapper or not. And so on.

**Eloquent** and **Query** extend standard Eloquent capabilities by providing automatic filtering, sorting, pagination and complex subquery building.

**HLEx** is an addendum to Laravel's `HTML` class with some useful functions.

Source code is extensively documented with examples so please refer to it for more information. Feel free to drop by [Laravel.ru](http://laravel.ru)'s forums.
